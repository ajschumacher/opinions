# A Distributed Network of Metrics

An *opinion* is a small data structure suitable for the capture and exchange of data like:

- Facebook-style "likes" for a topic, statement, business, or URL,
- Reddit-style "upvotes" on a news articles and other URLs,
- Netflix-style "star" ratings for movies,
- Amazon-style "star" ratings for books and other products,
- OKCupid-style [Likert-scale][likert] survey responses,
- Yelp-style restaurant reviews,
- Agreement with various political positions,
- PGP-style levels of trust in various cryptographic keys,
- etc.

The majority of development notes are captured in [DESIGN.md][] in this directory.

This is a project toward the development of:

- first, an open specification for opinion exchange, and
- second, various reference implementations of software which conform to that specification and demonstrate how to use and manage opinion data.

The author aims to create a specification suitable for acceptance as an [IETF Internet-Draft][] and eventual publication as an [Internet RFC][].

## Versions

The earliest timestamp I can find in my notes for this idea is September 12, 2011. This repository was created September 17, 2011.

In January 2012 this project was forked (by me, as the sole author) at commit `7680ead` and improved in secrecy as part of my employer's self-directed research program similar to [Google's famous "20% time."][google-20-time] Some or all of that research _should_ eventually be merged back into this repository, _pending their appoval_. Until then, this project will move forward from the point it existed prior to January 2012.
