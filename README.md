# A Distributed Network of Metrics

This is a project to design and implement a distributed, open system that can gather and analyze "opinions." The majority of development has been toward a design document, see DESIGN.md in this directory.

A system like this could become the foundation for distributed analogues to

- social news sites like Reddit.com,
- social sites' rating feature like Google Plus's "+1" or Facebook's "Like",
- trust systems like PGP or Advogato,
- rating systems like those employed by Amazon, Netflix, Yelp, OKCupid.
